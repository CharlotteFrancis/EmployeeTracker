## Description
Employee tracker is an application that lets you manage a database of employees with various data attributes! It is programmed in JavaScript and uses the Inquierer and MySQL2 packages from npm. The database is only linked locally since I am at this point not sure how to deploy a database.

Here is an image of the application in use:
